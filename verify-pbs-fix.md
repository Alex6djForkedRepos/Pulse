# PBS Form Fix Verification

## What was broken
1. When editing a PBS node, the form wouldn't populate with PBS data
2. PBS forms could show PVE data if a PVE node was edited first

## What we fixed
In `/opt/pulse/frontend-modern/src/components/Settings/Settings.tsx`:
- Lines 886 and 1063: Added `setCurrentNodeType(node.type as 'pve' | 'pbs');`
- This ensures when editing any node, we set the correct type

## How to verify the fix works

### Test #1: PBS form after PVE
1. Go to Settings â†’ Nodes
2. Click "Add PVE Node" 
3. Fill in some data
4. Press Escape to cancel
5. Click "Add PBS Node"
6. **VERIFY**: PBS form should be completely empty

### Test #2: Edit PBS node
1. Add a PBS node with test data
2. Click the edit icon on that PBS node
3. **VERIFY**: Form should show the PBS node's data

### Test #3: Edit PVE after PBS
1. Add a PVE node
2. Add a PBS node  
3. Edit the PBS node
4. Cancel
5. Edit the PVE node
6. **VERIFY**: PVE form shows PVE data, not PBS data
