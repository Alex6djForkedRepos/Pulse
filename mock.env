# Mock Mode Configuration
# This file is part of the repository and provides default mock mode settings.
# Mock mode generates realistic test data for development without requiring real Proxmox infrastructure.
#
# Quick Start:
#   npm run mock:on   # Enable mock mode
#   npm run mock:off  # Disable mock mode
#   npm run mock:edit # Edit this configuration
#
# The backend automatically reloads when this file changes (no manual restart needed).
#
# Documentation: docs/development/MOCK_MODE.md

# Enable/disable mock mode (false = use real Proxmox infrastructure)
PULSE_MOCK_MODE=false

# Number of mock nodes to generate (mix of clustered and standalone)
# First 5 nodes form a cluster, remaining nodes are standalone
PULSE_MOCK_NODES=7

# Average number of VMs per node
# Actual count varies based on node role (vm-heavy, container-heavy, light, mixed)
PULSE_MOCK_VMS_PER_NODE=5

# Average number of LXC containers per node
# Containers have lighter resource usage than VMs
PULSE_MOCK_LXCS_PER_NODE=8

# Enable realistic metric fluctuations (CPU, memory, disk, network)
# When true, metrics change every 2 seconds to simulate real workloads
PULSE_MOCK_RANDOM_METRICS=true

# Percentage of guests (VMs + containers) that should be in stopped state
# Set to 0 for all running, 100 for all stopped, 20 for realistic mix
PULSE_MOCK_STOPPED_PERCENT=20

# Local overrides (not tracked in git):
# Create mock.env.local for your personal settings - it will override these defaults
