# Remaining Action Items for Pulse

## Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. Respond to GitHub Issues
- [ ] Post migration guide link to issue #248
- [ ] Post installation workarounds to issues #251 and #252
- [ ] Close issues #249 and #250 as fixed in v4.0.1

### 2. Monitor PR Status
- [ ] Check status of Proxmox VE helper script PR
- [ ] Once merged, update README to remove warning

### 3. Consider v4.0.2 Release
Given the documentation improvements and user confusion, consider releasing v4.0.2 with:
- Migration guide included
- Updated README with clear warnings
- Helper script status documented

## Known Issues to Track

### v4 Issues
- Fresh installs failing due to helper script (PR submitted)
- Migration documentation was missing (now added)

### v3 Issues (Not our focus)
- #243: Security mode password issues
- #245: Can't add 3rd node (limited to 2 nodes)
- #246: v3.42.0 build broken

## Future Improvements
1. **Update install.sh** to better detect and handle v3 installations
2. **Add authentication** to v4 (currently no login system)
3. **Create automated tests** to prevent installation issues
4. **Update Docker Hub** description with migration warnings

## Communication Plan
1. Update release notes for v4.0.0 and v4.0.1 to link to migration guide
2. Consider pinning an issue about v3â†’v4 migration
3. Add migration warning to Docker Hub description
